[This course](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en/course/8059) is an undergraute level course on optimization. My work mainly includes delivering tutorials from beginning to end, holding review sessions and office hours.

Tutorials and Review Sessions
-----
Tutorials are about helping students review and understand the materials of the lectures. I conducted two one-hour tutorials for over forty students every week, offering them classic convex optimization problems as an exercise to help review methods to solve linear programming, support vector machine, non-linear problems, etc.

The review tutorials are in the form of a QA session, where students can ask questions about the materials of the lectures and the already-graded homework.
