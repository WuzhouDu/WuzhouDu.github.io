[This course](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en/course/8085) introduces the fundamental concepts of programming and problem-solving using `Python`. My work includes guiding students through resolving classic algorithmic challenges like the Eight Queens Problem and provided explanations of the first two assignments, clarifying concepts and answering questions to enhance understanding.
