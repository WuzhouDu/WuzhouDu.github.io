[This course](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en/course/8091) is an introductory course to operating system. My work includes preparing the project 3, delivering tutorials about project 3, holding office hours and answering questions on Piazza.

# Modification on Project 3
This project is basically from the [memory map lab](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2022/labs/mmap.html) of [MIT 6.828](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828). [Tianci Hou](tiancihou@link.cuhk.edu.cn) and I modified the lab to fit the course and the environment of CUHKSZ. We added some new tests and requirements to the lab, such as the whether the memory is page-aligned and whether the implementation of memory map correctly handles the offset of the file. We also made some efforts to make the output more readable.

# Delivery of Tutorials
The tutorial slides are to be anounced soon.
