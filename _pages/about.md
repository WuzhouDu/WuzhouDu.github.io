I'm a Computer Science and Engineering undergradute student in [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHKSZ)](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en), expected to graduate at the spring semester of 2024. Further, I will continue at the Master of Computer Science and Engineering (CS75) program in UCSD this fall.

I'm interested in software development and have experience in web and app development. My technical skills include MERN(MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and Flutter.

I'm also exploring my research intersts in operating system, distributed system, and compiler. Now I'm self-learning the textbooks and working on the course projects of [CSAPP](https://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/) and [MIT 6.824](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/).

I'm open to any opportunities in software development. If you are interested in my profile, please feel free to contact me via email or LinkedIn.
