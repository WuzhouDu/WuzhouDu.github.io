I just completed my bachelor degree of Computer Science and Engineering at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHKSZ)](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en). Further, I will pursue the [Master of Computer Science and Engineering program](https://cse.ucsd.edu/graduate/degree-programs/ms-program) in [University of California San Diego](https://www.ucsd.edu/) this fall.

I'm interested in software development and have experience in web application development. My technical skills include MERN(MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), Flutter and C/C++.

Now I'm training my skills in C++.

I'm open to any opportunity in software development. If you are interested in my profile, please feel free to contact me via email or LinkedIn.
