I'm a Computer Science and Engineering undergradute student in [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHKSZ)](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en), expected to graduate at the spring semester of 2024. Further, I will pursue a Master of Computer Science degree at University of California, San Diego this fall.

I'm interested in software development and have experience in web and mobile app development. My technical skills include React and Flutter. Now I'm trianing my skills in Go.


I'm also exploring my research intersts in operating system, distributed system, and compiler. Now I'm self-learning the textbooks and working on the course projects of [CSAPP](https://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/) and [MIT 6.824](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/).

I'm open to any opportunities in software development. If you are interested in my profile, please feel free to contact me via email or LinkedIn.
